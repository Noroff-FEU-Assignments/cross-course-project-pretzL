      At GameHub, it is our mission to make sure you find your next favorite game, at a price you're happy with. Our
      Advanced algorithm will suggest games based on previous purchases, wishlist items and which games you're looking
      at the most to make sure you find the perfect fit for you. When you're done playing, you can resell the game on
      our marketplace so others can enjoy that game as much as you have -while making some of your money back!
